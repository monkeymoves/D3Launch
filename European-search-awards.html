										<!-- <p> <strong>D3 (Data Driven Decisions) was created in September 2019 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-horsington-3b73534a/"
											> Kate Horsington.</a></strong> </p> -->
										<p>	As a relatively young agency D3 was delighted to have been shortlisted in 5 categories at this years European Search Awards
									    </p>
										<p> The event was a fantastic opportunity to meet talented teams and individuals
											from across the sector, as well as for the D3 team to enjoy a few well earned days in the beautiful city of Barcelona.
										</p>
										<h3>What are the European Search Awards?</h3>

										<p>The <a href="https://europeansearchawards.com">European Search Awards</a> celebrate the
											very best of SEO, PPC and Content Marketing across the EU. Each year,
											hundreds of search and digital agencies, as well as agencies from around the
											globe who deliver work in the European market,
											submit entries in various hotly contested categories. </p>

										<p>From the best use of search in retail, travel and gaming, to the best PPC
											campaigns, the best SEO campaigns and much more, these prestigious awards
											are a real opportunity to showcase the work of agencies
											and their clients from a diverse range of sectors. <a
												href="https://europeansearchawards.com/2022-winners/">
												2022 Award Winners</a>.</p>
										<p> The event was hosted by Ricky Merino at a gala dinner and awards
												ceremony at <a href="https://europeansearchawards.com/the-event/">La Llotja de Mar, Barcelona, on Thursday 26th May 2022.</a></p>

										<h3>What categories were we shortlisted in?</h3>

										<p>	The European Search Awards felt like an unmissable chance for us to have our work
											recognised on an international scale amongst some of the very best digital
											agencies. </p>

										<p>We chose to enter 5 different categories, with our submissions focussing on
											our work with client <a href="https://www.traveline.cymru/">Traveline
												Cymru.</a> In February 2021, Traveline Cymru came to us wanting to
											promote their new <a href="https://myhealthjourney.traveline.cymru/">
												‘myhealthjourney’</a> website,
											which provides public transport information for hospitals and medical
											settings across Wales.</p>

										<p>Set against the backdrop of essential travel restrictions due to the
											Coronavirus pandemic, a small budget and tight time frame, we carefully
											selected audiences for this PPC and Social campaign across Google, YouTube
											and Facebook to maximise reach and relevance.
											With over 1 million impressions and nearly 12,000 clicks, we were thrilled
											with what we were able to achieve in such a short space of time, making this
											the perfect showcase for our award submissions.</p>
										<p> We were over the moon to discover we had been shortlisted
											in the following <strong>5 categories:</strong></p>

										<ol>
											<li> <strong>Best Small Agency:</strong> D3 is a small organisation, with
												Managing Director and award-winning PPC specialist Kate Horsington at
												the helm. Whilst many agencies running as a multi-team operation,
												the success of D3 over the last 2 years is testament to Kate’s hard work
												and ambition to deliver the very best for her clients. This certainly
												rang true on the case of Traveline Cymru’s ‘myhealthjourney’ campaign,
												which Kate expertly delivered while continuing to provide a high-quality
												service for D3’s other clients.</li>
									
											<li><strong>Best Use of Search (Travel/Leisure) (PPC): </strong>Following
												the success of the ‘myhealthjourney’ campaign, entering this award
												category was a no-brainer. The campaign was designed to increase brand
												awareness and help
												those making essential journeys access the information they needed. The
												campaign was also underpinned by messages of considering the
												environmental benefits of using more sustainable transport modes, which
												influenced our
												use of keywords and topic targeting.</li>
											<li><strong>Best Use of Search (Health): </strong>We felt our
												‘myhealthjourney’ campaign would stand out from the crowd in this
												category. The aim of the campaign was to help thousands of healthcare
												workers and their patients across
												Wales reach their healthcare appointments, on time and as safely as
												possible, which we achieved. The service itself was also created with
												the support of health boards across Wales, meaning it was designed with
												the
												needs of its diverse userbase in mind.</li>
											<li><strong>Best Use of Search (Third Sector/Non for Profit):
												</strong>Traveline Cymru is a non-for-profit organisation that provides
												free public transport information. It was important to us that the
												campaign was delivered in accordance
												to their brand identity, which included being bilingual. With its Welsh
												language component, Facebook was an important part of our campaign
												strategy.</li>
											<li><strong>Best Small Budget Campaign: </strong>With the client being
												non-for-profit, as well as constraints due to the Coronavirus pandemic,
												this was a low-budget campaign with ambitious targets. We made sure the
												campaign told
												a story through bespoke illustrated imagery that was clear and
												consistent, used careful audience targeting, relevant messaging and
												calls-to-action to maximise the campaign’s reach and increase brand
												awareness.</li>
										</ol>

										<h2>How did the Awards event go?</h2>

										<p>The awards took place at the beautiful La Llotja de Mar, Barcelona, on Thursday 26th May 2022.. Representing D3 was Managing Director Kate Horsington, Luke Maggs,
											and Ellie Jerman. This was the first time we had all been able to travel
											face-to-face(with all work on this campaign having taken place remotely) so there was
											even more reason to celebrate.  We spent a few days ahead of the event exploring Barcelona and finally headed to
											the drink’s reception, dressed to impress!</p>
										<p>Once all the guests were seated in the hotel’s ballroom, Ricky Merino
											kicked off the evening’s proceedings and introduced event organisers We Are
											Search. We then tucked into a delicious
											3 course meal and got to know our talented table neighbours and fellow Award Winners <a href="https://www.reprisedigital.co.uk/"> Reprise Digital</a>
										<p>With our drinks at the ready, it was wonderful to witness so
											many talented agencies from across Europe be recognised for all their hard
											work. We were humbled and blown away when Ricky announced that D3 came out on top winning Best PPC Low Budget Campaign (We also picked up a Silver award for the best use of search (health) with our innovative Traveline "Keep Healthcare Moving" campaign!)</p>

										<p>Being an award winning agency is testament to all of Kate’s hard work, but also the work
											of the entire Welsh transport industry to keep public transport services
											running for key workers and those making essential medical journeys during
											the pandemic.  We can’t wait to see what opportunities the next year brings and
											and look forward to helping many of you along the way </p>
