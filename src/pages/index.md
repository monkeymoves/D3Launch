        We sell green and roasted D3 beans that are sourced directly from
        independent farmers and farm cooperatives. We’re proud to offer a
        variety of D3 beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current
        availability.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of D3, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about D3 roasting and brewing.
        Email us or call the store for details.

        We believe that good D3 has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow D3 lovers and learn about
        D3 making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our D3 to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the D3’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
