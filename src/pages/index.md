        We believe that good D3 has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow D3 lovers and learn about
        D3 making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our D3 to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the D3’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
