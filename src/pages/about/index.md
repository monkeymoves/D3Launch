### About Us
In an increasingly challenging business environment, getting your digital marketing right is essential.
But with so many different ways to spend your budget, cutting through the waffle and getting results
isn’t always easy.

Enter D3. We take the guesswork out of digital marketing, using data-driven decisions to make sure
your budget is being spent in the right places. We’ll help you get your products or services in front of
customers and, importantly, convert them into sales.

### Who we are
D3 was founded by <a title="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate-horsington-3b73534a/">Kate Horsington</a>, an award-winning PPC specialist with over a decade working in
some of the most competitive and challenging areas of digital marketing at London Stock Exchange-
listed GoCompare Group PLC. Kate brings extensive knowledge of managing multi-million-pound
budgets for household name brands and has a track record of delivering outstanding results.
Whether you’re a small business looking to dip your toe into digital advertising or an established
brand who needs additional support with big campaigns, D3 can give you a vital advantage over your
competitors using our analytical, scientific approach to marketing.

### Why we are different 
D3 stands for Data-Driven Decisions – these are at the heart of everything we do. Simply, we’ll help
you make informed choices on your digital marketing, and ensure that every pound you spend is
working as hard as it can.
We’re different from most digital agencies. We won’t bamboozle you with buzzwords, and we won’t
promise you things that aren’t deliverable. We won’t charge you for services you don’t need, and as
we don’t have expensive overheads, we can pass the savings on to you.
