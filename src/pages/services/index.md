### PPC Account Audit & Automation

Pay-per-click or ‘PPC’ advertising can be an incredibly effective marketing tool when done properly.
But if you don’t know what you’re doing, or are making decisions without data-driven insights,
services like Google Ads can be an expensive money pit.

D3 can manage your PPC campaigns – from keyword research, managing budgets, creating landing
pages and providing copy which sells, we can help you make sure that your ad budget delivers
maximum results.

### Paid Social campaigns
Social advertising is a fantastic way of getting through to your target audience. D3 has extensive
experience of putting together great paid social campaigns which cut through the noise and deliver
for our clients. We can help identify your core audience’s interests, what platforms they’re using,
and manage your budget to make sure that your paid social campaigns are successful and scalable.

### Analytics
A data driven culture is built on asking the right questions and clear measurements of success.
There’s a world of insight to be gained from data - but it can be hard to know where to begin with so
much information at your fingertips. D3 can help you dig deep into the numbers and use them to
your advantage. We can test, analyse and improve your campaigns, as well as help you pin-point
your customers and determine how best to reach them.

### Training
Enable your staff with the skills they need with bespoke training sessions led by D3 founder Kate
Horsington.
Kate has vast experience of building award-winning digital teams: the PPC department which she led
at GoCompare won Best In-House Team at the prestigious UK Search Awards in 2017. Kate can
identify key strengths and room for development, devising training plans to address your digital skills
gap.
With D3’s training, your staff will learn from real-life, practical case studies and gain invaluable
insight, ticks and tips to plan, research and deliver killer digital marketing campaigns. 

### Multimedia Creation & Brand Promotion
 D3 can produce compelling content based on analytical market research, behavioural insights & cutting edge digital storytelling.
 We can help you create brand videos, photoshoots, AR/VR experiences and web interactives that inspire your customers and drive sales across channels.
